# Fourier Transform 101
This repo is to get my hands dirty with Fourier Transform and signal processing.
Starting from the very basic (a simple sinusoidal signal), to something a bit more complex on which I apply filters and try to isolate the different components.
The last part is about analysing a kind of pulsed signal (i.e. finite in time and therefore not periodic).
